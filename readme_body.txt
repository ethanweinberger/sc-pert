# sc-pert - Machine learning for perturbational single-cell omics

*This repository provides a community-maintained summary of models and datasets. It was initially curated for [(Cell Systems, 2021)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cels.2021.05.016).*

We [curated a list of perturbation-related tools at scrna-tools](https://www.scrna-tools.org/tools?sort=name&cats=Perturbations). Please consider further updating and tagging tools [there](https://github.com/scRNA-tools/scRNA-tools).

This [spreadsheet of a subset of perturbation models](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1nqNg0DW1-Om7WtvRS20q-6b28usVRv5czOcxgj83Sgg/) includes more details, and is the basis of the table in the article.

Below, we curated a table of perturbation datasets based on [Svensson *et al.* (2020)](https://doi.org/10.1093/database/baaa073).
